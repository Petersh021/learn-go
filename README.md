# learn-go
This repository contains my journey of learning Go (Golang). I structured this into folders by topic, with progressively more complex examples.

ðŸ“˜ Topics I'm covering:
- Basics: variables, conditionals, loops, functions
- Structs & Methods
- Interfaces
- Concurrency
- Web programming (HTTP servers)
- Problem-solving exercises

ðŸš€ Stay tuned for real-world Go projects as I advance!
